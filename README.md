# AI-Driven-Indoor-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
Indoor air quality impacts health and productivity, yet most existing monitoring systems provide raw data (e.g., CO2 or PM2.5 levels) without actionable insights. This project aims to build an AI-powered system that interprets air quality data and offers recommendations for improvement.
